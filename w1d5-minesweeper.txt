# Minesweeper

**Read all these instructions first. There are useful hints at the end
of this document.**

Everyone remembers [Minesweeper][play-minesweeper]
([wiki][minesweeper-wiki]), right? Let's build it!

Start by supporting a single grid size: 9x9; randomly seed it with
bombs. The user has two choices each turn:

### Reveal

First, they can choose a square to reveal. If it contains a bomb, game
over. Otherwise, it will be revealed. If none of its neighbors
contains a bomb, then all the adjacent neighbors are also revealed. If
any of the neighbors have no adjacent bombs, they too are revealed. Et
cetera.

The "fringe" of the revealed area are squares all adjacent to a bomb
(or corner). The fringe should be revealed, but should contain counts
of how many adjacent bombs are adjacent.

The goal of the game is to reveal all the bomb-free squares; at this
point the game ends and the player wins.

### Flag bomb

The user may also flag a square as containing a bomb. A flagged square
cannot be revealed unless it is unflagged first. It's possible to flag a
square incorrectly, so the behavior should be the same regardless of
whether there's a bomb in that square.

Flags are there to help the user keep track of bombs and do not factor
into the win condition. Once every square that isn't a bomb has been
revealed, the player wins regardless of whether they've flagged all the
remaining squares.

### User interaction

You decide how to display the current game state to the user. I
recommend `*` for unexplored squares, `_` for "interior" squares when
exploring, and a one-digit number for "fringe" squares. I'd put an `F`
for flagged spots.

You decide how the user inputs their choice. I recommend a coordinate
system. Perhaps they should prefix their choice with either "r" for
reveal or "f" for flag.

### Code Review

After you have your UI working, request a code review from your
TA. Take notes and refactor before moving on.

### Saving

OK, it's time to add save/load functionality. You should be able to
save/load your minesweeper game to/from a file.

As a bonus, you may also wish to track the time it takes for the user
to solve the game. Perhaps you might keep track of the ten best times
in a leaderboard. You may want to keep separate lists for the
different sizes. It's up to you!

### Bonus!

- Colorize!
- Cursor Input! ([This][keypress] is a good starting point)
- [Go wild][awesome-sweeper]

### Hints

I think you should have a `Tile` class; there's a lot of information
to track about a `Tile` (bombed? flagged? revealed?) and some helpful
methods you could write (`#reveal`, `#neighbors`,
`#neighbor_bomb_count`). I would also have a `Board` class.

You should separate logic pertaining to Game UI and turn-taking from
the `Tile`/`Board` classes.

You'll want to pass the `Board` to the `Tile` on initialize so the
`Tile` instance can use it to find its neighbors. But then if at some
point you use `p` to print out a `Tile` instance, you'll get way more
info than you need, as the data for the `Board` it holds will also be
printed. You can fix this by overriding (defining) the `inspect` method
in your `Tile` class, having it return a string that contains just the
info you want (e.g. the `Tile`s position and bombed, flagged, etc. state).
See [here] for more info if you need a refresher on how to do this.

If you use command line arguments and `ARGV` to specify the name of
the save file to load, you may be surprised to find that console input
is broken. [This ruby-forum.com post][argv-description] explains how
`gets` interacts with `ARGV`/`ARGF`.
